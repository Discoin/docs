# User's Guide

This guide contains frequently asked questions during Discoin transactions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you farm currencies,** specifically, if you operate a server exclusively for earning currencies for Discoin-participating bots, or we've found you intentionally spamming each bot to earn currencies, we'll notify all participating bot owners. In other words, **you are punished.** In Pollux, you risk your profile being wiped out. In other bots, you also risk you or your guild being blacklisted. We have the ability to track down each server and user's activity, so please don't try us.

## Can I spend Discoins?

No. Discoin only exists during the transaction process and statistics: As a temporary currency, Discoin can only be converted from one currency to another; as a universal _unit_ for calculating currency, it is only used for calculating exchange rates.

## Can I have a transaction record?

[https://dash.discoin.zws.im/](https://dash.discoin.zws.im/)

## I did not receive my payment!

1. Check [the Transaction Record](https://dash.discoin.zws.im/). If it says the transaction isn't handled, the receiving bot hasn't processed it yet - By standard, bots should pick up its transactions on a 5-minute interval - so just wait patiently.
2. If it has been more than 5 minutes and the transaction still isn't handled, contact the developer\(s\) of the receiving bot.
