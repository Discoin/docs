# What is Discoin?
Sometimes users find it hard to earn a specific virtual currency on one bot, but they have plenty of things they could spend it on. Other times, they find it easy to earn another bot's currency, but they have nothing to use it on. In the end, users will abandon both bots and turn to a bot that allows them to earn and use currency wisely and more freely.

Introducing **Discoin**, a universal system allowing users to exchange currencies from one bot to another bot.
