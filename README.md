## What is Discoin, really? \(For developers\)

Sometimes users find it hard to earn a specific virtual currency on one bot, but they have plenty of things they could spend it on. Other times, they find it easy to earn another bot's currency, but they have nothing to use it on. In the end, users will abandon both bots and turn to a bot that allows them to earn and use currency wisely and more freely.

Introducing **Discoin**, a universal system allowing users to exchange currencies from one bot to another bot. Originally made in 2017, its intent is to connect various bot economies with other bots in order to facilitate growth between bots. You can read the [Developer's Guide](developers/guide.md), or ask us any questions you have at the server above!
